Today, I visited my favorite noodle shop to enjoy Abura Soba after a long while. I’ve cherished it for nearly a decade because it’s always been delightful. After enjoying the meal, I visited an earphone store. There were many good earphones and headphones. I found a pair of headphones I wanted, but they were quite pricey, leaving me undecided. I browsed through other headphones and earphones, yet none sparked my interest as before. Later, I visited a computer store, where I checked out MacBooks, iPads, and various accessories. However, I didn’t find anything compelling enough to purchase. My desires for material things have lessened over time. Instead, I found myself more drawn to learning new things and reading books.
