Internet Explorer reaches the end of the line today.

It is my first desktop browser to open a Web page though my first experience of the Internet is with ezweb.
After I started working as a Web developer, I developed Web applications opened on the IE and I had trouble with bugs that occurred with only the IE.
I have many memories of it.  
I believe the IE had contributed to the development of the Web.

Farewell, IE!
