I played futsal for the first time in 2 months.
I couldn't run and enjoy playing it with the backache as I wished the last time, but I didn't have backache this time.
My coworker told me that I could run longer than the last time.
Thanks to building up at the gym so I developed my physical strength, I enjoyed playing to the end.
However, I couldn't keep running physically as I wished to.
So I want to build up my strength and have more fun the next time.

And today is my brother's birthday. CongratsðŸŽ‰
