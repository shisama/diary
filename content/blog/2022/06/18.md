I went out with my family. We went to the restaurant to eat burgs. After that, we went to an event of animation my daughter likes. At the event, she was so excited by watching the show and playing the game and toys. However, she was selfish to want her parents to purchase toys for her. We scolded her because of her attitude. She started crying loudly. She seemed to be in a bad mood for a while, but she recovered her spirits completely thanks to the delicious noodles we had for dinner. I played all day today, so I will study and work tomorrow.
