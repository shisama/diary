Thank God it's Friday. I asked my team members if I could learn English for 1 or 2 hours during my work time. They willingly accepted my request. I decided to make my English reach the level I could facilitate the meeting and talk about complicated technical issues without interpreters. To achieve the goal, I have to take more time to practice English than I expect.

By the way, I watched a YouTube video where Avril Lavigne sings 'Complicated.' It took me back to my teenage years. Her first album is the CD by American musicians I first bought in my life. I often listened to it when I was a junior high school student. I'm glad she is still popular.
