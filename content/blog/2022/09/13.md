I started an online English teaching platform named 'sptr.jp'. I took my first class today. The different point from other platforms is that students use materials on sale commercially. I used a textbook to improve my skills in making sentences quickly. I have already read it but have wanted to review it for a long time. Although the lesson was a bit easy, I felt this was an opportunity to reread it. In addition, I can check my pronunciation and what I spoke soon because the instructor recorded a video and sent it shortly after the lesson. It is excellent. I will have classes every day for a while.
Also, I can ask Japanese instructors to give me some advices on how to learn and practice English. So I will consult with them tomorrow.
