I haven't written my diary for over a month. I started my new term for the university at the beginning of this month. I'm learning computer systems. In the first week, I learned Boolean functions and logic gates. I know them because I learned them to pass the examination for an IPA qualification long ago. I'm in the second week of the course and learning Boolean arithmetic and ALU, Arithmetic and Logic Unit, in the current unit. It's a little more difficult than the previous week. And I have already read the materials and done some assignments. I'll complete the tasks until Wednesday.
