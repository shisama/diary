I took a midterm examination of the computer systems course. I'm happy that I got the perfect score. However, I couldn't complete all assignments by the deadline. I think there are a lot of assignments to do. So I can't have the time to do any other things such as writing code or learning English in my private time. I have to find some ways to manage my time.
I almost forgot to look into the cause of the failed tests on my pull request for Node.js.
I want to do it tomorrow.

By the way, I'm recently in watching YouTube videos created by Ruri Ohama. She uploaded many videos to introduce how to learn foreign languages in English.
My motivation to watch her videos is caused by her English. Her English is easy to understand for me. She is very fluent although she is not a native speaker. What's more, she is cute.
I'm subscribing to her channel and will watch some of her videos at breaking time.
