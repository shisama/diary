I returned to my mother's home because I had helped her move to her new home. My mother lives with my grandmother. They are old.
After movers and we packed goods and brought them to a new home, I saw the empty room and felt sad because I had a lot of memories in that home.
I had lived there for about 20 years.
I often played with my brother and friends in my room as a child. I usually practiced the guitar in the room as a high school student. I studied to pass the examinations in the room. I made good memories in the room.
I feel a little sad thinking I will never return to the old home.
Thanks to the house for giving my family a lot of memories and happiness.
