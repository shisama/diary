My daughter's athletic meeting was held today. She joined the parade playing the drum, read the athlete's oath of fair play, danced the traditional Japanese dance, and performed in a relay race. This is the last athletic meeting in her nursery room. I was moved by her performance in that she played the drum along with the tempo. Then, she did forward upward circling on a horizontal bar, jumped over a vaulting horse, turned backward, and walked on stilts. Then, I felt she danced a Japanese traditional dance better than other kids. She must have practiced a lot. When she participated in a relay race, she cheered the other kids in a loud voice and ran as well as she could. I was a little lonely because of the last athletic meeting in the nursery room. But it was a day I felt her growth.
