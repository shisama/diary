Recently, I often felt that it comes to be difficult to keep my motivation up on learning at the university. That's why I have taken much time to learn so that I can't take time to do other things. I like learning, but I think it hard to keep a balance among work, family, and learning. On the other hand, I have been able to keep motivated to learn English since I started using English for work. However, I often cannot understand long conversations and complex topic.
