This is the first post in 2022. I have been lazy to write diary. These days, I have learned statics at UoPeople. I had never learned it so that it is a little difficult for me. It takes a long time to complete the tasks of the course every week. So I feel it makes me annoyed that I couldn't have much time to write a book.
By the way, today is the final day of a long vacation named 'Golden Week'. I will have to work again tommorrow. It's a blue monday.
