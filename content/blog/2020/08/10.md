I ate grilled meat (yakiniku in Japanese) for lunch with my family.
After lunch, we went to a home improvement store. I bought a step stool so that my daughter will be able to go to the bathroom by herself.
At first, she couldn't do well and cried. But she is gradually becoming able to do it.
I'm glad to see my daughter's growth.
