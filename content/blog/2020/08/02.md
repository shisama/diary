I have had a cold since this Monday. I have had a sore throat and a fever. However, I wrote a post about technology on my blog for the first time in a long time.
Also, I created an account of ProctorU.
I was requested to write a book about web frontend security. But I wonder if I should receive the request. I think it will take a long time to write a book.
I had not studied for 20 hours this week because of having a cold and taking a time to write a blog post. I will achieve it next year.
I am reading the book titled "But how do it know?". It is written about the basic principles of computer. I have read 70% of the book. It is very interesting.
