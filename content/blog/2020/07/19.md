I decided to restart writing my diary to improve my English skill.
I read the book titled "Make Time" as one of my teammates taught me it was a good one. It was written about how to focus on what matters everyday.
According to the book, it is good to fill my calendar with the schedule of the day in the morning. I have tried it for this week.
I feel it is effective as I don't have to be worried about what next to do after finishing somehing. So, I will keep it for a while.
By the way, I applied to UoPeople. Finally, I will be a college student from September 3.
I'm looking forward to studying academic subjects like computer science.
