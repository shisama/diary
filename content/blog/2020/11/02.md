I have not written my diary for a long time. I started to study at the University of the People on September 3. I have wanted to study computer science and get a degree. I decided to apply to the UoPeople because I would be able to learn online and its tuition is free. However, I have to hand in assignments and take exams in English. So, the students whose mother tongues are not English had to show their skills to use English well. If I had TOEFL score, IELTS score, or other qualifications, I could prove my English skills. But I didn't. So, I had to take an English course named "English Composition 1" and pass it with its final exam. So I had taken courses and handed in assignments for nearly two months. On October 29, I took the final exam and did all of the courses. I don't know if I will pass the exam. I'm worried about the result. I want to see the result soon!!
