Today I went to karaoke with my family. As my daughter said that she wanted to go to karaoke, We went there after lunch. We spent 5 hours there and sang many songs. However, my daughter didn't sing much. After leaving there, I asked her if she enjoyed karaoke. She answered she enjoyed it but felt a little sleepy. And I asked her if she wanted to go there. She answered "Yes." So I thought she enjoyed karaoke. We went to a Chinese restaurant for our dinner. I played much to release my stress today and had a lot of fun.
