I published a new blog article about napi-rs. napi-rs is the tool to write Node.js addon in Rust with Node-API. napi-rs allows developers to publish npm packages for cross platforms. napi-rs provides cross compiler to compile Rust code to native binaries for multiple platforms like x86-macos, arm-windows, arm-linux, and so on. It supports many platforms. I want to use it to re-write fsevents in Rust. I am looking forward to creating it and learning Rust and Node-API.
