I haven't written this diary in this year. I would write it again. 
Today, I went to a karaoke store with my family. I haven't gone there for a long time due to the COVID-19 restriction.
We enjoyed singing. My daughter had never been there. This is the first time to go there.
I asked her whether she enjoyed singing there. She said 'yes'.
I want to go there with my family again.
