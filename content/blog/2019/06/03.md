I took my daughter to nursery school as usual. Hand‐foot‐and‐mouth disease("手足口病") is expanded in the school. A nursery teacher saw my daughter's hands and foots and said that my daughter seems like the desease. She asked me to take my daughter to hospital and ask the doctor if my daughter can be deposited. So, I went to a hospital with my daughter and see a doctor. It was OK to deposit her at the nursery school. We went back to the school and I deposited my daughter. I went to the office afternoon.
