My wife and I took the wedding photo today. 3 years ago, we were going to take the wedding photo at Okinawa but I rained suddenly at the time. So we gave up.
Today I wore Hakama and tuxedo. My wife wore Kimono and wedding dress. Also, my daughter wore Yukata and dress. Some photos for two, my wife and me. Some for three, my wife, daughter, and me. We had a lot of fun. The photographer in charge is very kind. I think it was good to take the photos. It will be one of memories of a lifetime.
