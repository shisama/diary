I went to Grandfront Osaka for TypeScript meetup named kansai.ts. I made a presentation. I was interested in other presentation. In particular, talk about AssemblyScript. AssemblyScript is the compiler for TypeScript to WebAssembly(WASM). It allows developers to write TypeScript for WASM. We can use C, C++, Rust, Go, Kotlin and so on for WASM. However, most frontend engineers can write TypeScript and like it. With TypeScript, WASM codes can be very maintainable. I tried to use AssemblyScript. It is not so hard. I will keep catching up the information about AssemblyScript.
