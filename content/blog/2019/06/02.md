Today I did almost nothing. I am worrying about the offer. It asks me to be a database engineer. I have worked as a web engineer. Especially, I have developed web applicaition for a long time. I am good at JavaScript, Java. However, the offer requires me to learn python, PHP. What's more, I will have to learn OpenStack, DBaaS, RabbitMQ and so on which I have never used. I cannot imagine what I will do. In a sense, it is a career change. It is highly challenging for me. I am stressful.
