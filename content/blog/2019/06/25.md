I went to Tokyo to do job interview and had a dinner with the engineers who work in the company. The office of the company was very cool. I could see Tokyo Skytree fron the office. I think that it is near the Tokyo station nice. I enjoyed to have a dinner. We talked about the company, careers and so on. I came back to Osaka in the day. I was a little tired.
