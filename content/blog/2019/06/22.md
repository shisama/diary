I came back to my hometown. I have to clean mine in my mother's house. My grandma and my mother will move. So, I disposed my cloths and sold books and CDs. The books were over 100. CDs are over 30. The amount of the money are 2990 JPY.
I ate my favorite noodles and sweets. I had not eated them for a long time.
