I did a job interview today. I was the interviewer. The interviewee has good skill and good mind. However, he is so young and doesn't have enough experience. It is difficult to decide to pass him. More or less, the job interview may be related to his life. The interview is quit difficult. I thought so again. I was worrying very much. I was so exhausted today.
