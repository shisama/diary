Today I studied English today. I repeated shot sentences. I will study English tomorrow.
I have an interview with one of my team members. We talked about career, local community and OSS activity. These days, I have been worrying about my career since I was 30 years old. I am interested in management. However, I am more interested in technology. I am worrying which I should select manager or specialist. I think I don't have management experience much. So, I will try it.
