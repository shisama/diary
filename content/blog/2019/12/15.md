I got up late at 11:00. I cleaned windows and bath room. My wife cleaned inside of the refregiator. She worked so hard that it was very clean. I went to Expo Commemoration Park(a.k.a 万博記念公園 Banpaku kinen koen) to eat out noodles and see illuminations with my family. It was very cold. However noodles were so good and illuminations were very beautiful.
