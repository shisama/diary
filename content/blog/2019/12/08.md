I went to [GDG DevFest Osaka 2019](https://gdgosaka.connpass.com/event/150645/). It is the event about technologies of Google. I knew some new things. One is [Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run/). It is available to use serverless technology with container technology. I have heard it but never used it. I think studying the cloud container technology is must. I do think I must study it. The other I am interested is about installing Web app. I thought this theme is about PWA, but it included TWA and Web Bundles. I have never implemented them. I am interested about them. Also, I could know new things about PWA. `navigator.getInstalledRelatedApps` is new Web API. Developers use the API and can know if Native App was already installed. It is very useful. [This page](https://web.dev/get-installed-related-apps/) tells details more. I want to try them. I enjoyed the event and learned many things.
