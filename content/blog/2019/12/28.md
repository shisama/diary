I went to drink with my friend at Umeda. I have not seen him for years. We talked about a lot of things. I first met him 8 years ago. We worked together as translators. He has been good at speaking English because he went to University in California. However he does not usually speak English now. He sometimes speaks English when he goes to meetup. He often travels all over Japan. He stays in Tokyo for more than 3 months in year as total. He will go to Tokyo January 7 for buisiness trip. He looks very busy. Anyway I was glad to see him today.
