Today I went to nursery school to see my daughter's dance. The kids performed their dance once a year. They were so cute. I felt the growth of my daughter. They made believe they were potatos and they were cooked. After that, My family and I ate out. We ate curry and hormon. I love it. After I ate, I went to meetup and made presentation. Then, I went to clothing store and bought Patagoia mountain parka. It makes us very warm. It became my favorite.
