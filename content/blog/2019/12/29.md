My wife and my daughter went to my wife parents' house. So I was boring that I went to meetup of kansai frontend user group. I prepared the slide and made presentation. I talked about prettier plugins and Abstract Syntax Tree. They are very useful. Especially, AST is very interesting for me. My team members also like manipulating AST. After meetup, we drank and ate sushi. I drank too much. However it was a lovely time.
