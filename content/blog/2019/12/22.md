Today I wrote a blog post about type-fest which is a library providing utility type definition collection. They are composed with complicated type definitions. So called, type pazzle. However, the reading type definition codes are intresting for me. I have not written all type definitions of type-fest yet. I will write the rest of them soon. I want to write them in 2019.
