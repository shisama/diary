Today is the final day when I go to the office of weblio, inc. I have worked for 3 years in weblio, inc. 3 years ago, I had not known about the most part of web application. Especially, infrastructure. However, I can use nginx, docker, ansible, and other infra tools. I had never used Node.js for production. However, now I am Node.js collaborator. I was not good at JavaScript and frontend frameworks. However I will work for next company as a frontend expert. I have learned many things in this 3 years. I appreciate the company and all team members.
