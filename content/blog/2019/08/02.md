I went to Kyoto to attend Open Source Conference and host a event named 'Kansai Node Gakuen' ('関西Node学園'). 
In Open Source Conference, I was interested in elastic APM and kibana. I asked many questions to speaker about APM. I could know how to get Node.js and Frontend performance metrics with APM. I want to use it. 
I held Kansai Node Gakuen in LINE KYOTO office at Shijo Karasuma. I could learn about TypeORM(Node.js OR Mapper library written with TypeScript), how to write React component with canvas, about memory leak in V8, about Firebase Cloud Functions with TypeScript. I had fun time. I am looking forward to hold next event.
