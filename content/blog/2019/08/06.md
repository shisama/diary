Today I saw a dentist. I don't feel pain on my teeth but I have not seen a dentist for a long time. I want a dentist to check my teeth. Fortunately, I don't have bad teeth. However, the dentist said that I am clenching my teeth during sleep. She adviced me to wear a mouthguard. However, I don't like it...

I created Pull Request for unstated-next which is a library to manage state in React. I translated README into Japanese.
I think it is a good library.
