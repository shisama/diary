I have studied English all day today. I decided to spend my summer vacation to study English for two weeks. I enjoy studying English. I took an online lesson with a teacher in this morning. I studied with the material "どんどん話すための瞬間英作文" again this afeternoon. I had already finished the material but I want to review it. I will keep being hard to study English for two weeks.
