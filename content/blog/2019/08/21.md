We got up early this morning. We went to a church where Bocca della Verita is. We arrived there too early to enter the church. It was going to open at 9:30 but we arrived at 8:30.  However, workers in the church allowed us enter there. It was very special. We took pictures. A woman who is one of them guided us in the church. We appreciate them. After leaving the church, we went to Piazza Navona. It is an open space where there are three famous fountains. Then, we went to Piazza di Spagna. It is very famous place where Audrey Hepburn ate ice cream in the movie 'Roman Holiday'. However, eating there is forbidden now. Next, we went to Fontana di Trevi. It is famous big fountain where some sculpures are. It is very beautiful but very crowded. Then we went to Campo de Fiori. It is market. I bought olive oil for my mother and grandmother. Next, we went to Colosseum. It is very big stadium built about 1900 years ago. After that, we went to Foro Romano. There are several ancient buildings there. View from high hill was beautiful. Then we went to Baths of Caracalla. There are ancient baths. Before coming back to hotel, we went back to Colosseum to see illumination. Though we enjoyed sightseeing, we were so exhausted.
