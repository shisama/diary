Since today, the long vacation has started. I have taken a vacation for a month. The 1st day, I watched the movie the title of which is 'Weathering with you'(in Japanese '天気の子'). Its director is Makoto Shinkai who directed 'Your name.'(in Japanese '君の名は。'). The both movies are great. I like them. However, I prefer 'Weathering with you' to 'Your name.' because character setting is complex. Main characters are teenagers and their home environments do not look like good but they are living hard in Tokyo.  
By the way heroin's name and my daughter's name are same. So, I might have empathy with the story.
