I have had a stiff neck for a long time. Especially, I feel pain on my neck these days. Before I got married, I injured my neck when I went snowboarding with my wife. I have been suffered from a slipped disk since then. Now I don't feel pain usually, but I do sometimes. Perhaps It will last in my life. It is very hard. I hope it will be better.
