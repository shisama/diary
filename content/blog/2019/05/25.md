I recovered from the cold and went to Banpaku Memorial Park ("万博公園") for my daughter's excursion. I's very hot today. We enjoyed it and I could communicate with other's children's parents. After that, My family and I went to Expocity where is air-conditioned. We spent some hours there. Then we went back to Bnapaku park to enter the Tower of the Sun ("太陽の塔"). However, my daughter started crying in the tower. It is a litte afraid for her. My wife enjoyed walk around in the tower. We bought the dinner on the supermarket and came home. We are exhausted. I had a lot of fun today.
