I went to Tokyo today for job interview. I was nervous. I am concerned about the salary. If they present the income which does not reach to amount I want, I will negotiate not to regret. However, the job sounds like attractive for me. There sounds like the job I have never experienced. If I could work there, I will be more excited than my current job.
