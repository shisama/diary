This afternoon I took my daughter to Namba. It has not benn there for a long time. We went to bookstores to look for the book titled '虚数の情緒' but I coudldn't find it. After that, we went to a restaurant named 'ニューミュンヘン' with my mother and my grandmother. We drunk beer and ate chikens and so on. My granddmother bought my daughter a picture book. She looked happy. We finished dinner and said goodbye to my mother and my grandmother. Then we went to a computer shops to look for a tablet whose display size is 10 inch. I found a tablet. It is made by fujitsu and named 'Arrows Tab Q506/ME'. It has 4core cpu, 4GB RAM, 64GB Disk and Windows 10 Pro lands on it. It is nice price(¥9,980)! I bought it. After I came back home and took shower, I setup the tablet. Of course I wrote this entry with the tablet.
