I have had a headache all day long. I slept in this morning and left home at noon. I had worked for 4 hours today. After work, I went to Osaka to take job interview. I got the offer. However, the company offered lower salary than I hoped. Of course, the amount of the salary is higher than my current salary. So, I am worried which I should accept the offer.
