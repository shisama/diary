I went to dinner with an engineer who works other company. He worked as a manager but he removed manager position from the company. There are no manager in the company now. It is very intresting. I am interested in the company. I expected he would tell me that he wanted me to join the company. My expectation was right. I was very happy for it. However, other companies want me to join them. I am worried...
