I started writing diary to improve my writing skill in English. I use [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) for this diary.
I will keep writing as long as possible. I will write once a week at least.

I have had a sore throat and a fever for three days. Also, I have been absent from working for three days.
Today I am better than yesterday. So, I decided to create English diary with GatsbyJS.
First, I built this site with [gatsby-starter-lumen](https://github.com/alxshelepenok/gatsby-starter-lumen). 
However, gatsby-starter-lumen requires many meta data (`title`, `date`, `template`, `draft`, `slug`, `category`, `tags`, `description`) every article.
It was annoying me.
It can be solved, but I wanted to start as easy as I can.

So I decided to change and use [gatsby-starter-blog](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog). It requires few meta info. It requires `title`, `date`, `description`. It is fewer than gatsby-starter-lumen.
However, I want to complete date and title automatically.
If you know about it, please cantact me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/shisama_).
