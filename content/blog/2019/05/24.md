I was absent from work today. I have a fever and I have felt a pain in my throat since last night. I have lain on my mattress all day long. I watched the movie title of which is "パコと魔法の絵本". I have watched the movie. I like it.
Tomorrow an excursion is going to take place for my daughter. I want to go. My fever is going down litte by little.
