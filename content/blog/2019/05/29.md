The cold has been going. I feel better than yesterday.
I went to Angular meetup (ng-kyoto) after work. I don't know much about angular. I have used AngularJS (version 1.5) but I have never used later versions. I learned about them especially latest version 8.0.0. It evolves and is much better than version I have known. Its performance is very fast. It is for small / mid / large applications. 
I will not use angular maybe but I use its essence for my application and other JavaScript libraries. So, I think it was better to go the meetup.
