I got early at 5:15 and left my house at 5:50 to come to the office earliest and open the key. I started working so early that I left the office early at 4:20. I noticed there were more people on the way home at that time than when I always leave the office. There were more students. To my suprise, there were many office workers. Maybe they didn't go to their house but they were working.
I was so sleepy that I went to my bed just after I had dinner. I slept more than 4 hours.
